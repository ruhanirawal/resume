RoboWar 
Developed a combat bot weighing 8kg for IIT Kanpur and IIT Delhi. I worked in the electrical domain for this project and a lot through the process. 

Bot Bolt, NIT Jalandhar
• Won RoboRace Challenge at NIT Jalandhar by successfully passing through several hurdles.

Cosmo Clench, IIT Delhi
• Won Cosmo Clench at IIT Delhi by navigating obstacles and inserting blocks in the correct locations with the use of a gripper. I worked alongside a teammate to build the gripper of the bot.

Science-a-Thon, LPU
• Won an innovation challenge with the idea of an Autonomous Road Patching Bot. Patent for this project has been filed.
This project involves identification and measurement of depth of potholes with the help of ultrasonic sensors/lidar(based on use case) and camera which then triggers flow of a compound mix through a pipe. After the pothole
has been filled it is levelled using a roller in the front of the bot.
A minimal prototype has been developed and video is in the link below.

GUJCOST
This is an ongoing competition under the gujarat government in which we are working on developement of a hexapod(6-legged) robot which can provide first aid care in cases of natural disasters like earthquake.
Currently we are in the stage 2 of the competition (Prototype Submission). A video has been attached in the link below.


Note: I am working on 2 other Ideas however since the patent for them hasn't been filed yet, I can not disclose the particulars.
